		<h3>Breif Overview of Development</h3>

		<p>For this project the aim was to make a board game based on a theme that was relevant at the time. My group chose to use covid as at the time this was heavily in the news. The main goal was to make this board game physically and my group was going to use tabletop simulator as a practice version. However due to covid and the first lockdown we were not able to make the board game physically therefore we had to put everything into the digital version. </p>
		<p>We took most of the inspiration for the board game from the board game battle sheep as we really liked the creating your own board mechanic. This allows for the game to have replay ability and allows the users to develop a strategy that includes the board. Some of the main problems during development was trying to make sure that the game didn’t go on for too long as this could cause problems with people getting bored and trying to make the game interactive each turn for each player. During the game all players are playing against the board or the virus. The player’s job is to stop the virus spreading this can be done through research cards. During development trying to make interesting cards for the players to use without making them too strong was tough but with the play testing that we used this wasn’t a problem. </p>
