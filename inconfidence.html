		<h3>Contributions To Project</h3>
		<p>I started off the cohort project being a system rep this started out by talking to the other system reps and working out how to start the project and how to allocate tasks to each of the group and to start constructing the TDD. To start this, we each started to talk about what the project needed to do well and then over Christmas this all got added into the project. Then we all talked and decided on what our groups would be best at and decided which system our groups would get to work on. My group got given UI this included systems such as notebook, map, minimap, emote wheel, character customisation. The system that I work on was the map and the notebook. For the alpha I created a map that when the user pressed tab a map would pop up. At this stage it was only a place holder image that was put on screen. Next was the notebook this was used to enhance the confide system the early design of this was similar to the picture with a icon on screen that when opened had tick boxes and depending on the people in the game would display all the peoples names and then allow them to confide with them. The notebook then got pushed back to beta/release this was because the feature required more networking that was not implemented at that time also there was other jobs that were higher priority. This then led to the both the features getting cut as the notebook was deemed not needed the same as the map. </p>
		<p>Next, I was assigned to the pre game lobby. We both talked and decided that we wanted the pre game lobby to have every IP’s assets in and be like a portal with the portal leaking out. The initial design was going to be a big island with different spawn points and the different portals spread out however some feedback to this was that the island was too big. So, we scaled this down to a small ring with portals going around the ring and a portal in the middle which acted as a vote for a random map. Then I coded the map voting system so that when a player stepped on a player, they would cast a vote and if the player wanted to change their vote, then they code by just choosing a different portal. There was also a UI at the top of the screen that showed the votes for each map. This was not networked but we were planning on doing so in the future. All of this was either changed or cut however the base design stayed and was used to create the final lobby with the assets.</p>
		<p>This then lead on to the beta stage of development and starting to create a level. In this stage my job was to create the level and add in the tile map. This was done by looking at the assets that we were given and then trying to implement them all in one level. Then adding a tile map collider for all the walls and trees so that the players cannot just walk through everything.</p>
		<p>Once the tile map had been created, I started to add different assets into the level such as bin bags, cars, rotten food, and trolleys. This was to make the level more interesting and alive. Later on this included adding in more effects such as fire to the level to add more juice to the level.</p>
		<p>Once the level design was completed, I started to create a task for the level. The task that I decided to create was a task that had the user stack the shelves. To complete this task the player had to move the fruit into the correct position on the shelf.</p>
		<p>Next I cleaned up the levels Z ordering as some object was loading over the player this was something that needed to be cleaned up. As well as fixing all the z ordering problems in the level I added some effects to the level such as fire into the level and some more sprites into the level.</p>

		<p>Here is a video showing my contributions to the game and also how my groups level turned out.</p>
