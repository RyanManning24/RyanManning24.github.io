		<h3>Contributions To Project</h3>

		<p>For the game my job was to get the cart to move on the rails and make sure that all the special rails don’t break the cart. This was tough as the cart kept slipping through the tracks colliders especially when the cart was going up hill, down hill or dropping from one track to another. The way this was overcome was using sphere colliders on the wheels and then a separate collider on the cart itself and each track with its own collider as well. This then worked and allowed the game to play as intended.</p>
		<p>I worked on testing the game. This involved trying to make sure all the special tracks worked and did not breaking anything to bad. One bug that was found was u can stack jump tracks on one spot and this then applies the jump force multiple times. Therefore, it fires the cart into the air which can lead to some interesting behaviours. This bug was kept as it allowed for fun and interesting gameplay as it gives the players freedom to create interesting tracks.</p>
