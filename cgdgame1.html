		<h3>Contributions To Project</h3>
		<p>For this game, I was tasked with coding the enemy’s behaviour. I worked specifically on the draugr and the wolfs behaviour. This behaviour was making sure that the wolf and draugr would walk towards the player and attack them whilst also making the enemies not feel too like each other. This was achieved by making the wolves attacks faster and making his movement speed faster meaning that then the enemies had a different feel to them.  When placing them in the game world it was important to try to give the player enough room to fight the enemies whilst also making sure that the combat was challenging enough to reward the player. Then I added the ability to change the sprite to red once it has taken damage this then allows the game to clearly indicate to the player who has taken damage.</p>
		<p>My final responsibility was to play test the game and find any bugs that were in the game. One of the major bugs that was found was that the spike puzzles hurt the player even if they were not being stood on. This was because the spikes were colliding against the player characters sprite and not just the player characters feet. As well as finding bugs play testing the game to make sure that the gameplay was fair and that the game wasn’t too hard was also important.</p>
