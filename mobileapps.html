		<h3>Breif Overview of Development</h3>
		<p>The goal of this project was to create an app that works on either iPhone or android phones. I chose to create a app for android devices. The app I created was an app that shows upcoming games to the user and gives them some details about the game. </p>
		<p>Here is the a video showing the apps full functionality.</p>

		<p>I created an app in android studios, that shows the user some games with details on those selected games. Originally the plan for this was to use the twitch API to dynamically show the user new game releases however this cause some trouble to set up and, in the end, I decided it would be better for the project to code this myself. The app has different pages which the user can navigate through to find the information that they would like to see. As well as this i tested the app and collected feedback from users which i used to generate new features for the app and also where i could look for improvements on the app itself and the apps design.</p>
