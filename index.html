		<h3>About</h3>
		
		<p>I am a current master’s student at the University of The West of England (UWE) studying commercial games development. During my time at university, I have experience in level design, creating AI, UI development, audio development and integration and some mobile development.</p>
		<p>I have projects where I have created an open world game with infinite world generation and NPC’s, an AI squad controller, a simple first person game in DirectX and a among us style game. I have also made a board game which is on the steam workshop for tabletop simulator. (link the steam workshop). And a project that delt with camera behaviours.</p>
