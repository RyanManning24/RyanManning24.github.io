		<h3>Breif Overview of Development</h3>
		<p>The goal for this project was to create a first person shooter using directX 11. I created a small level for a first person shooter which allowed the player to move around in the level. 
Firstly, for this project I had to use directX to draw a triangle on the screen this would then provide a good base for moving this project into 3D and try to understand how the directX pipeline works. During this stage I also wanted to make sure that the project had a easy to read file structure and allowed me to add objects easily. This then allowed moving from a simple triangle to a 3D world with a cube in it a lot easier. 
Next was setting up the camera for the player to control so that the game had movement this was done through various matrixes and translating them in reference to the inputs on the keyboard. Once the player could move around and look around, I added in a class for the floors and the walls this would allow me to instantiate this object as many times as I needed to.
