		<h3>Breif Overview of Development</h3>
		<p>I created a camera system that allowed a user to chose from multiple different camera perspectives. The aim of this project was to create something that could be used to allow making levels and games easier as the camera view/collision is all taken care of or very simple to impliment and would require little to no coding.Here is a video showing an example level showing off all of the camera's features.</p>

		<p>Development started with me researching the different camera types that i wanted to support. Once i had outlined these i started work on trying to implement the third person camera and collision. This turnt out really well and allowed me to use this as a base for the other cameras. Then i played around with the lerp function in unity to move the cameras to different spots around the player to emulate all the camera types.</p>
		<p>For more details on my project i wrote it all up in this document <a href="docs/cctp.pdf" download rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   here.
		</a>Which also contains a project plan and a dev log of the project.</p>
