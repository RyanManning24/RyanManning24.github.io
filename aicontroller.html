		<h3>Breif Overview of Development</h3>
		<p>I created a squad AI system that allows the player to control a squad of 4 AI. Some of the commands that I implemented was a move system where the user brings up a wheel with move commands and formation commands for the squad members. Also, two buttons can set the squad on follow or not follow this will cause the squad to move in the selected formation. The squad has automatic fire on any enemies that are in the world if the enemy steps inside the squads firing range. As well as this if the squad members get hurt below twenty five percent health, then the squad member will run to the nearest cover and use the heal mechanic which is when they are out of combat for a certain period then they will get healed over time.</p>
